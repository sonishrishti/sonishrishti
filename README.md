# 👋 Hey there, I'm Shrishti!

I'm a **lifelong student** and a passionate explorer of all things **cybersecurity** 🔐 and **augmented reality** 🕶️. Currently diving into the world of **penetration testing** as part of my MSc, but my goal is to grow across the full cybersecurity spectrum.

### 🧠 My Learning Philosophy

A great conversation with Howard (at a cybersecurity event!) introduced me to the **T-shaped learning model** — build broad knowledge across domains, then go deep into one. That clicked with me, and it’s exactly how I’m structuring my cybersecurity journey here. 💡

### 🛠️ On This GitHub

I'm documenting my journey — from pentesting to entrepreneurship — with the hope that:

- I get to learn from *you*, too!

Whether it's building a better understanding of security concepts, experimenting with AR, or just sharing a cool project — you’ll find it here.
